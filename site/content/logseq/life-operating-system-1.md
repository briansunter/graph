Most of what I do in logseq is centered around "projects"

# Intro to my task management system
heading:: 1

I categorize my tasks into four categories:

## routine
heading:: 2

Routine tasks I have tasks I have scheduled every day, like exercise, cooking, or chores. I use recurring scheduled tasks for these

Example: My daily warmup routine

It shows up with a link to the embedded warmup video routine each day, then is hidden when I check it off, until the next day.

I have similar tasks that repeat at different intervals, for example, every few weeks a todo shows up on my daily notes telling me to schedule a haircut.

```
- LATER [[5 minute morning warmup]] [[mobility]]
SCHEDULED: <2022-06-05 Sun .+1d>
```

## adhoc
heading:: 2

Adhoc tasks are small random tasks that pop up, like responding to an email

There are lots of good tools for capturing and organizing these with queries in logseq

Just get everything in daily notes, tag it, and query it later.

`TODO Respond to [[Eric Smith]] [[email]]`

## Long Term Goals
heading:: 2

These are my most ambitious goals that take months or years long effort.

I reflect on these and my values each year as a part of my yearly planning

These aren't traditional "SMART" goals, they're meant to set my vision of what a great life could realistically look like. Sometimes they'll be completed, but I always like having a north star to strive for.

Some examples of values are: having a great group of friends, improving my relationship, becoming financially independent, being physically strong, learning new things

Some examples long term goals related to these values would be starting a business, buying a house, starting a family, etc.

## Short term projects
heading:: 2

Projects are anything that requires more than a few hours or few steps to complete, typically these are 1-3 months for me, but can be as short as a few days.

These are basically traditional SMART goals.

I try to attach each project to a long term goal or value it supports.

For example, a project could be to get my newsletter to 100 subscribers.

This seems like an achievable goal for a few months, where I can try some things and see if they work.

Each project has to have these things

End Criteria: Can I consider this "done"?

Time bound: Must have a deadline, even if I adjust it later

Mid point check in: half way between the start date and end date. I evaluate how things are going, and adjust the deadline as needed.
Expected outcome: What metric do I want to improve.

# Project Template
heading:: 1

I have a logseq template to help me quickly generate new projects. Feel free to copy it here [project/template]({{< sref "/pages/project/template" >}})

{{embed [project/template]({{< sref "/pages/project/template" >}})}}

## Tour of the [project/template]({{< sref "/pages/project/template" >}})
heading:: 2

Heres an examples for my [100 newsletter subscribers]({{< sref "/pages/100 newsletter subscribers" >}}) project

### Project Page Properties
heading:: 3

I have a number of properties in the project template to help me query it later

milestone date is a half way mark to re-evaluate the project and adjust the desired end date if need be

metrics are tags for anything quantifiable, like twitter followers.

``` clojure
name::
tags::[[project]] #project-template
start-date::
milestone-date::
desired-end-date::
metrics::
type:: project
```

# Working on projects
heading:: 1

Most of my time and focus is on my projects

After I do the things I have to do (adhoc tasks and daily routine) I spend focused time on my projects

I try to limit the number of projects I have going on at a given time (work in progress)

If you only have a few hours of free time per day, you can only have so many projects, assuming you work on them 30 minutes to 2 hours per day per project. Think about how much free time you have.

I usually don't work on the same project two days in a row. I like variety.

I use the Pomodoro method as often as possible. I set a time for 30 minutes or so and focus hard on a project, the take a break. The more focused sessions I can get in per day the better.
