Werner Herzog is a German filmmaker who has produced, written, and directed more than sixty feature and documentary films. I appreciate his unconventional creativity and the sound of his voice.

He's known for producing ambitious experimental films, like "Grizzly Man," a documentary about a grizzly bear expert (who was eaten by a grizzly bear)

I'm excited to watch his new movie, "Theatre of Thought," about brain-computer interfaces and consciousness.

## Werner Herzog's Rogue Film School

Herzog teaches his unconventional approach to filmmaking in his workshop called [Rogue Film School](http://www.roguefilmschool.com/default.asp)

Here's the intro to the school, which does a good job of illustrating his philosophy.

> “The Rogue Film School is not for the faint-hearted. It is for those who have travelled on foot, who have worked as bouncers in sex clubs or as wardens in a lunatic asylum, for those who are willing to learn about lock picking or forging shooting permits in countries not favoring their projects. In short: for those who have a sense of poetry. For those who are pilgrims. For those who can tell a story to four year old children and hold their attention. For those who have a fire burning within. For those who have a dream.” — Werner Herzog

[Here's an account of someone](https://www.indiewire.com/2014/09/12-things-i-learned-at-werner-herzogs-rogue-film-school-69693/) who went through Herzog's Program

> Depending on the materials, the attention will revolve around essential questions: how does music function in film? How do you narrate a story? (This will certainly depart from the brainless teachings of three-act-screenplays). How do you sensitize an audience? How is space created and understood by an audience? How do you produce and edit a film? How do you create illumination and an ecstasy of truth?

>Related, but more practical subjects, will be the art of lockpicking. Traveling on foot. The exhilaration of being shot at unsuccessfully. The athletic side of filmmaking. The creation of your own shooting permits. The neutralization of bureaucracy. Guerrilla tactics. Self reliance.

## Werner Herzog's Advice for filmmaking

This is his advice for filmmaking, from the book [Werner Herzog – A Guide for the Perplexed](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KEW6ACQ?tag=mus0a-21)

Always take the initiative.

There is nothing wrong with spending a night in jail if it means getting the shot you need.

Send out all your dogs and one might return with prey.

Never wallow in your troubles; despair must be kept private and brief.

Learn to live with your mistakes.

Expand your knowledge and understanding of music and literature, old and modern.

That roll of unexposed celluloid you have in your hand might be the last in existence, so do something impressive with it.

There is never an excuse not to finish a film.

Carry bolt cutters everywhere.

Thwart institutional cowardice.

Ask for forgiveness, not permission.

Take your fate into your own hands.

Learn to read the inner essence of a landscape.

Ignite the fire within and explore unknown territory.

Walk straight ahead, never detour.

Manoeuvre and mislead, but always deliver.

Don’t be fearful of rejection.

Develop your own voice.

Day one is the point of no return.

A badge of honor is to fail a film theory class.

Chance is the lifeblood of cinema.

Guerrilla tactics are best.

Take revenge if need be.

Get used to the bear behind you.

I'm hoping to watch some more Herzog films this year to learn more about his style and philosophy.
