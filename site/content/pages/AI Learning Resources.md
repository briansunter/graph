# Overview

I'm very eager to start studying AI, but with so much to learn, I'm not sure where to start. Do I need a lot of math? What kind? Which areas should I focus on? How can I make sense of all the topics? What tools should I use? Additionally, how is the field developing, and what direction is it headed in?

I'm a software engineer with some math under my belt, and my goal is to gain a thorough understanding of AI so I can apply it to my work. I'm particularly interested in generative AI, natural language processing, and building intelligent agents. I also want to gain the necessary math skills to have a strong understanding of the fundamentals, but I don't want to too bogged down in some of the advanced mathematical details.

To help me on this journey, I've collected and summarized the best courses and books to help me get started on the right foot. I included the topics covered by each resource, so the list got pretty long, but it gives me a better idea of what to prioritize and how things fit together.

These materials are roughly in order I plan to study them, though some of the materials at the end are pretty advanced. I want to start by getting a practical overview, then go deep on the math and fundamentals.

I plan on starting with some of the most popular courses, like Andrew Ng's Deeplearning.ai courses and the fast.ai courses.

Next, I plan to take a few other high quality courses like the 3blue1brown math YouTube courses, the HuggingFace course, and Andrej Karpathy's Neural Network courses.

Then I plan to study a variety of O'Reilly books focused on practical topics.

Finally, I plan to study more in depth materials, such as a Berkeley AI course, some math textbooks, and some of the famous AI textbooks.

It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.

The first textbook on pattern recognition to present the Bayesian viewpoint. The book presents approximate inference algorithms that permit fast approximate answers in situations where exact answers are not feasible. It uses graphical models to describe probability distributions when no other books apply graphical models to machine learning.

Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning.

Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, such as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods.

Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy.

The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.

## Topics

## Mike Jordan Book list

Extremely rigorous books recommend by Mike Jordan from Berkeley intended for those focused on research. I will probably never read these and feels impossible to get through these in one lifetime.

[Hackernews Comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1055389)

> Esentially all of the material in the following intermediate-level statistics book:

1.) Casella, G. and Berger, R.L. (2001). "Statistical Inference" Duxbury Press.

> For a slightly more advanced book that's quite clear on mathematical techniques, the following book is quite good:

2.) Ferguson, T. (1996). "A Course in Large Sample Theory" Chapman & Hall/CRC.

> You'll need to learn something about asymptotics at some point, and a good starting place is:

3.) Lehmann, E. (2004). "Elements of Large-Sample Theory" Springer.

> Those are all frequentist books. You should also read something Bayesian:

4.) Gelman, A. et al. (2003). "Bayesian Data Analysis" Chapman & Hall/CRC.

> you should start to read about Bayesian computation:

5.) Robert, C. and Casella, G. (2005). "Monte Carlo Statistical Methods" Springer.

> On the probability front, a good intermediate text is:

6.) Grimmett, G. and Stirzaker, D. (2001). "Probability and Random Processes" Oxford.

> At a more advanced level, a very good text is the following:

7.) Pollard, D. (2001). "A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability" Cambridge.

> The standard advanced textbook is Durrett, R. (2005). "Probability: Theory and Examples" Duxbury.

> Machine learning research also reposes on optimization theory. A good starting book on linear optimization that will prepare you for convex optimization:

8.) Bertsimas, D. and Tsitsiklis, J. (1997). "Introduction to Linear Optimization" Athena.

> And then you can graduate to:

9.) Boyd, S. and Vandenberghe, L. (2004). "Convex Optimization" Cambridge.

> Getting a full understanding of algorithmic linear algebra is also important. At some point you should feel familiar with most of the material in

10.) Golub, G., and Van Loan, C. (1996). "Matrix Computations" Johns Hopkins.

> It's good to know some information theory. The classic is:

11.) Cover, T. and Thomas, J. "Elements of Information Theory" Wiley.

> Finally, if you want to start to learn some more abstract math, you might want to start to learn some functional analysis (if you haven't already). Functional analysis is essentially linear algebra in infinite dimensions, and it's necessary for kernel methods, for nonparametric Bayesian methods, and for various other topics. Here's a book that I find very readable:

12.) Kreyszig, E. (1989). "Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications" Wiley.
