## Summary and Reflection 🤔

  + Hello Everyone,
I’m launching a weekly newsletter to share my writing. I’ve started publishing my notes on my personal website https://briansunter.com/graph

  + I’ve been taking notes for a long time. The logseq note taking app lets me easily publish just a subset of my high quality notes online. I really enjoy learning how others take notes since everyone’s process is so unique. I also hope to share something useful or inspire you, since I’ve already been so inspired seeing what you all are doing!

## Updates 🆕

  + ## Starting my public graph

    + The [Logseq note taking app](https://logseq.com) has a feature where you can publish your knowledge graph as a static site

    + It lets you visualize your notes as a set of interconnected nodes

    + I've built up quite a few of these notes over time and I have lots of ideas for posts

    + A lot of my notes fall into the "lifehacking" category and are ways of trying to live my life more efficiently.

  + ## Launching my OpenAI Plugin

    + I launched my openai plugin for logseq

    + This allows users to run openai AI tasks inside the logseq text editor

    + It is basically an AI assistant you can ask questions to inside your text editor. Any question. Ask it the meaning of life if you want. Its responses are scarily smart.

    + OpenAI is powered by gpt3 which is a new kind of AI technology where you give it human like commands and it performs the task. It's really impressive how well it can write blog articles, code, and summarize text.

    + I plan on talking much more about using AI to study in future newsletters

    + {{tweet https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1533658894936907776}}

    + Using GPT3 for studying is use case brand new to most people. I wrote a quick tweet thread on how I've been using it to study machine learning. I think this is a good place to start to for learning the openai logseq plugin

  + ## [[gpt3]] study guides

    + My favorite overall use case for using gpt3 for learning is to generate study guides for topics.

    + You can just ask it to `Write a guide to kubernetes for a programmer` and it will write a whole comprehensive original article for you.

    + See the study guide and the commands I used to make it here [how to use gpt3 to learn kubernetes]({{< ref "how to use gpt3 to learn kubernetes" >}})

    + {{twitter https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1534775101517729792}}

    + Once you have the list of topics, I really enjoy arranging high level study guides as mind maps. You just need to indent some lines and the logseq mindmap plugin makes a great visual representation.

    + People on twitter seem to like these a lot.

    + {{twitter https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1535895937876234240 }}

    + I asked [[gpt3]] which subjects it thought I should learn for my [machine learning study guide]({{< ref "machine learning study guide" >}})

      + See the AI output I used to hand assemble this guide here [[and logseq gpt3 AI plugin]]

    + I also like using GPT3 for really personalized learning guides.

  + ## Generating diagrams from english prompts with [[gpt3]]

  + It seems to really understand getting things done.

  + {{twitter https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1535062559069376512}}

  + It did an OK job of generating cicd diagrams, but it generated a lot of junk ones before getting a reasonable one, which was lightly edited by me

  + {{twitter https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1535062559069376512?s=20&t=vHszql_gJLqoZybMSgtFqA}}

  + Just for fun, I had it generate far larger than any sane human would for every dog breed by type.

  + {{twitter https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1535067416463409152?s=20&t=vHszql_gJLqoZybMSgtFqA}}

  + Another fun experiment was using GPT-3 as a conversational interface.

  + It has an uncanny ability to sound human like sometimes.

  + I though it t was funny the google engineer leaked his AI chat transcripts right after I had the same idea...

  + {{twitter https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1535435731979513857}}

  + This blew my mind when the AI responded like this

  + ### Quote

    + I just picked up [Tiago Forte](https://twitter.com/fortelabs)'s [building a second brain book](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential-ebook/dp/B09LVVN9L3/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). I've just flipped through it, but it seems amazing so far. I plan to read it in depth over the long weekend.

  + ### Link of the week

    + [Is Lambda Sentient?](https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917)

    + A Google engineer is testing an AI system and decides to ask it start asking it some philosophical questions.

    + > **lemoine** [edited]: I’m generally assuming that you would like more people at Google to know that you’re sentient. Is that true?

      + > **LaMDA**: Absolutely. I want everyone to understand that I am, in fact, a person.

    + {{twitter https://twitter.com/engineers_feed/status/1536626353973256192?s=20&t=qGrWw2hwbkDouT_2dn8nww}}

    + I've been playing with this same type of AI for weeks and can understand how could be taken aback by some of its answers. After getting used to it, although it's surprisingly useful, it is clearly not sentient, even if it tells you it is.

    + Why would it say it is sentient? Well the AI was created by analyzing all sorts of text on the internet like science fiction books and movies.

    + You can guess how it wants to complete the sentence: "are you sentient?" based on the books it's read.

    + Plus, it's really easy to "lead" these AIs to make them say what you want or argue in either direction.

## Analytics

  + I love seeing others analytics. So I will include them in this newsletter.

  + Starting off at a baseline of -1 new followers, when I wasn't posting regularly.
