If I could only pick one favorite podcast, it would be Huberman Labs, which is about health and neuroscience by a Stanford Professor, Andrew Huberman.

I've been listening to every one of the Huberman Labs podcasts in order, and I really enjoyed this one.

[MASTER YOUR SLEEP & BE MORE ALERT WHEN AWAKE - Huberman Labs Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/master-your-sleep-and-be-more-alert-when-awake/)

From a productivity perspective, sleep is one of my favorite subjects. I have trouble sleeping well consistently but feel so so much better when well rested.

Likely you aren't getting enough sleep - [33% of people are chronically sleep deprived.](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0215-enough-sleep.html) If you are trying to improve your life, fixing your sleep is the best place to start. Huberman points out in the podcast that some people have gone years without sleeping well. They don't even remember what it feels to be rested.

There are countless studies on how much sleep improves your health and performance, but it's impossible to quantify how much better your life is experiencing the world with a lucid mind.

There is a wealth of information in the podcast, but a couple points stood out to me, as someone trying to feel sleepy earlier.

Summary

Circadian rhythm is the sleep and wakefulness cycle you go through every 24 hours. It controls when you get sleepy.

There are two many levers that affect your circadian rhythm: temperature and light.

Getting bright outdoor light within 30 minutes of waking up sets your circadian rhytm.

You also should avoid any bright lights at night, between 11pm and 4am

Your core temperature will be at its lowest 2 hours before you wake up and gradually start to increase. Your temperature will peak around late afternoon and then gradually decrease towards the evening thus repeating the cycle.

So to adjust your circadian rhythm, warm your body up at the appropriate time, with exercise or even a heater to be more alert, then cool yourself down at night to fall asleep.

> Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability.

- Edsger W. Dijkstra

One of my favorite tech talks of all time is ["Simple Made Easy" by Rich Hickey"](https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/SimpleMadeEasy.md). It's mostly a philosophical talk, it doesn't have much code in it.

AI can play Stratego at an expert level now

Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that AI has not yet mastered.

This popular game has an enormous game tree on the order of 10^535 nodes, i.e., 10^175 times larger than that of Go.
