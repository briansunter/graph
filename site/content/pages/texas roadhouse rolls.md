## INSTRUCTIONS:

Roadhouse Rolls (around 65-68% hydration)

Preheat oven to 375F

In a medium-size pot, over medium-high, add the milk, bring it to a boil, cut the heat, pour it into a bowl, and cool it down over an ice bath. Once it cooled down, add 120g. of filtered water, heat it to 95F, and add the yeast, dissolve, and reserve.

In a stand mixer bowl, add the flour, sugar,  salt, and diastatic malt powder; this last ingredient is optional. (helps with color and flavor)

Using the hook attachment, add in a string the melted butter (not hot) and mix; once it is incorporated, add the milk and two whole eggs. Mix until the dough does not stick to the sides of the bowl.

Take your dough out, form a ball, place it into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for one to one and a half hours at room temperature or until it doubles its size.

Remove plastic wrap and punch your dough, put it on a floured surface, cut your dough into 40 even pieces, and shape them into balls.

Place the balls on a lined sheet tray, cover it with plastic wrap, and let them proof for twenty minutes.

Take the wrap off, spray them with water and immediately put them in the oven for 15 to 18 min.

Brush each one of the buns with melted butter, and sprinkle some smoked flaky salt on top.

### Cinnamon Honey Butter:

Place the softened butter, salt, a black pepper pinch, two teaspoons of cinnamon powder, a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg, and the beans of a vanilla bean pod in a mixing bowl and whisk until smooth. Add powder sugar and whisk vigorously to incorporate some air.

Add and incorporate honey.
