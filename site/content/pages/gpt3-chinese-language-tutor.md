# Special Purpose AI Tutor Chat Bots

Can you create a special purpose tutoring chat bot to teach yourself Chinese internet slang?

I learned a little bit of Chinese in college, but I only learned basic things from textbooks like how to talk about school and the weather.

I never felt comfortable with colloquial Chinese, and Chinese internet slang was especially difficult.

Can GPT-3 be used to create a specialized Chinese tutor chat bot to teach me Chinese internet slang for use on Twitter?
