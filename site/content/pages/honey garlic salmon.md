# Directions

  + Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside. Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler.

  + Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.

  + Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon.

  + Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.

  + Garnish with minced parsley if desired.

  + ### Notes

    + If you'd prefer, season salmon as directed, then pan sear in the pan.  Flip over and sear on the other side, then remove to a plate.  Add sauce ingredients to pan and cook until warmed through.  Add salmon back to pan and spoon sauce over the salmon.
