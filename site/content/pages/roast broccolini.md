# Ingredients
  + 2 medium bunches broccolini __(baby broccoli), just shy of 1 pound__

  + 2 1/2 tablespoons [extra virgin olive oil](https://amzn.to/34bAz5D) __plus additional as needed (do not skimp or it may burn!)__

  + 3 cloves garlic __smashed and peeled__

  + 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt __plus additional for serving__

  + 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

  + ### OPTIONAL ADDITIONS:

    + 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan

    + Pinch red pepper flakes

    + Freshly squeezed lemon juice

### Instructions

  + Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).

  + In a large bowl, toss the broccoli florets and minced garlic with olive oil and lemon juice until lightly coated. Sprinkle salt over the broccoli and toss to coat.

  + Arrange the broccoli florets in a single layer on a baking sheet that has been rubbed with some olive oil or lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

  + Roast at 425°F (220°C) for 16-20 minutes until cooked through (check by poking with a fork, should be fork tender) and lightly browned. The browned bits are the best! So don't worry if you see some charring.

  + Put the roasted broccoli back in the bowl and toss with lots of freshly ground black pepper and the grated parmesan cheese. Be generous with the black pepper, broccoli loves it!

  + Serve immediately.

### Notes

  + **TO STORE**: Refrigerate broccolini in an airtight storage container for up to 4 days.

  + **TO REHEAT**: Gently rewarm leftovers on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F.

  + **TO FREEZE**: Freeze broccolini in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before reheating.
