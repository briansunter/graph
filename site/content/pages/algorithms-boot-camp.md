# Intro

## About this Guide

Data structures and algorithms are among the most valuable concepts to learn in computer science.

I'm organizing some of my notes on data structures and algorithms in a "boot camp" form.

I'll teach you how to use data structures and algorithms to solve problems every week as a section in my [newsletter]({{< ref "newsletter" >}})

I'm not writing this guide from an expert's perspective but rather from a student's perspective. I'll be learning along with you and solidifying my own knowledge.

Feel free to [correct me, make suggestions, and ask questions on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/Bsunter) This guide is a living document; hopefully, a community of like-minded people will benefit from it.

## How the Bootcamp Works

I built out a complete outline for every algorithm topic here [algorithms-boot-camp/study-guide]({{< ref "algorithms-boot-camp/study-guide" >}})

The [complete guide]({{< ref "algorithms-boot-camp/study-guide" >}}) of what I plan to learn is extensive, so I'm building it out in public as a series of 3-month long "boot camp" learning sprints.

There's a curriculum for the next 3-months on this page, so people will know what to expect and can give their input on what they want to see.

I'll send a [newsletter]({{< ref "newsletter" >}}) post about a new topic each week. All the future topics are listed below.

If you're interested in learning algorithms or how to use logseq, you can follow me on this site, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Bsunter), or the [newsletter]({{< ref "newsletter" >}}) to get updates.

## Why Learn Algorithms?

Sometimes you will face a complex problem at work requiring in-depth knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

If you don't understand algorithms, you may accidentally write code that runs extremely inefficiently. If you're not careful, you can write code that works for small inputs but breaks on large ones later on. Or you might try to implement something that's not theoretically possible to do efficiently at all.

Companies are also asking questions like these in technical interviews, so even if you don't use them daily, you should know them if you're interviewing or conducting interviews. It's like the new IQ test.

## Who is this for?

You know a little bit of programming and want to get better at algorithms

You are an experienced programmer and want to solidify your knowledge of algorithms

You are interested in my process for taking notes on code in logseq
