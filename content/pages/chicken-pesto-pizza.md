## Ingredients

  + 1 ball pizza dough

  + 1/3 cup pesto

  + 1 tbsp olive oil

  + 8 oz mozzarella cheese (grated)

  + 1 cup seasoned grilled chicken (optional)

  + 2 tbsp pine nuts

  + 1 tbsp parmesan cheese (grated)

  + 1 tbsp basil leaves (fresh)

  + pinch red pepper flakes

## Instructions

  + Make dough according to the recipe's directions (or use store-bought dough); set aside.

  + Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

  + On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pizza dough into a 14-inch circle. Transfer to a parchment-lined pizza pan. Fold over the extra inch of dough to form the crust, pressing to seal. Brush with olive oil. Dock the center of the pizza with a fork to prevent large bubbles from forming. Place in the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, remove and set aside.

  + Spread the 1/4 cup of the pesto over top, then half of the mozzarella cheese. Toss the chicken in the remaining pesto and add the chicken, then top with remaining mozzarella and the pine nuts.

  + Place in the oven and bake for 7-10 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes, then sprinkle with grated parmesan, fresh basil and red pepper flakes, cut and serve.
