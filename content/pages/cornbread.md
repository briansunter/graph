# Ingredients
  + 1/2 cup (113g) butter

  + 1/2 bunch fresh sage

  + 1/2 bunch fresh thyme

  + 1.25 cup (185g) all-purpose flour

  + 1/3 cup (70g) sugar

  + 3.5 Tbsp (50g )light brown sugar

  + 1.25 tsp (6g) fine sea salt

  + 1 Tbsp (13g) baking powder

  + 1.25 cup (175g) yellow cornmeal (I think finer grind will be better)

  + 2 eggs

  + 1.5 cup (350ml) buttermilk

# Directions
  + Start by placing a cast iron pan into a cold oven and begin preheating to 400F.

  + In a small pot, add and melt the butter over medium heat.

  + Once the butter has browned, add in fresh sage and thyme. Stir around then place into a container and set to the side.

  + In a medium-size bowl, add and whisk together all the dry ingredients.

  + In a separate bowl, combine and whisk together the eggs then whisk in the buttermilk.

  + Remove the herbs from the browned butter and slowly whisk in the butter into the buttermilk mixture.

  + Whisk wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until well combined.

  + Remove the pan from the oven, spray with oil, and add in the batter spreading out evenly to the walls of the pan.

  + Place back into the oven for 20-25 minutes.

  + Remove and let cool for a few minutes before removing from the pan and placing onto a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
