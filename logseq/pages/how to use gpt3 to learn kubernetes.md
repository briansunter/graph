- GPT-3 is the ultimate learning and study tool
-
- I've been meaning to learn Kubernetes in depth for the longest time, so let's use my [OpenAI GPT-3 Plugin](https://github.com/briansunter/logseq-plugin-gpt3-openai) to help me out
- I'll narrate my process of how I use gpt3 and what "prompts" I use.
- I usually modify the output for my own purposes to clean it up, though sometimes the raw OpenAI response is really good. After generating the output I add backlinks to it.
- Prompts are basically ways of asking questions to openai that are known to produce a desirable output. There are certain ways of asking it things that work better than others.
- Basically I ask it to create high level overviews and outlines, the ask it follow up questions to get more details based on the outline it produces.
- This guide just assumes you have a basic knowledge of OpenAI and GPT-3. You just need to know that you send it a human like command and it gives you a response, based on data from a huge training set. It can do well at both technical and creative use cases, in my experience. [Learn more about GPT-3 here](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21355768/gpt-3-ai-openai-turing-test-language)
- **==I'll highlight the prompts I send to OpenAI to write this article==**
	- The blocks nested underneath are OpenAI's responses.
- To use OpenAI with my plugin, you just type `/gpt3` on a selected block or right click on the block menu.
- Let's start with an overview of what you should know about openai, in addition to following its [usage guidelines.](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines)
- ## OpenAI Completions, Prompts, and Prompt Design
- From, [the OpenAI docs. Go here for more info](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion)
- OpenAI calls the main service they provide a "completion"
	- > You input some text as a prompt, and the model will generate a text completion that attempts to match whatever context or pattern you gave it. For example, if you give the API the prompt, "As Descartes said, I think, therefore", it will return the completion " I am" with high probability.
- ==**What is an openai completion?**==
	- An openai completion is a machine learning model that is trained to predict the next word in a sentence.
- So, it's sort of like "autocomplete" for everything.
- ## Prompt Design
- > Our models can do everything from generating original stories to performing complex text analysis. Because they can do so many things, you have to be explicit in describing what you want. Showing, not just telling, is often the secret to a good prompt.
- "Prompts" are basically
- ### Basics
	- ==**Summarize this text:**== Show and tell. Make it clear what you want either through instructions, examples, or a combination of the two. If you want the model to rank a list of items in alphabetical order or to classify a paragraph by sentiment, show it that's what you want.
		- For example, if you want the model to do a certain task, show it examples of inputs and outputs for that task.
	- Provide quality data. If you're trying to build a classifier or get the model to follow a pattern, make sure that there are enough examples. Be sure to proofread your examples â€” the model is usually smart enough to see through basic spelling mistakes and give you a response, but it also might assume this is intentional and it can affect the response.
	- ==**Summarize this text:**== Check your settings. The temperature and top_p settings control how deterministic the model is in generating a response. If you're asking it for a response where there's only one right answer, then you'd want to set these lower. If you're looking for more diverse responses, then you might want to set them higher. The number one mistake people use with these settings is assuming that they're "cleverness" or "creativity" controls.
		- 1. Set temperature and top_p settings to lower values if you want the model to produce repeatable results with one right answer.
		  2. Set temperature and top_p settings to higher values if you want the model to produce more diverse results.
- ### Troubleshooting Queries
- Is it clear what the intended generation should be?
- Are there enough examples?
- Did you check your examples for mistakes? (The API won't tell you directly)
- Are you using temperature and top_p correctly?
- ## Examples from OpenAI
- ### Classification
	- Note how they give it examples and set it up to "complete" the rest.
	- > To create a text classifier with the API, we provide a description of the task and a few examples. In this example, we show how to classify the sentiment of Tweets.
	- ```
	  Decide whether a Tweet's sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.
	  Tweet: I loved the new Batman movie!
	  Sentiment: 
	  ```
	-
- ### Text Generation
- In addition to giving it examples and letting it "complete" them, you can outright tell it to do someting which often works well. I sometimes use a combination of direct generation commands and examples
- ==Brainstorm some ideas combining VR and fitness:==
	- 1. A VR fitness game that simulates different obstacles courses or running environments to make working out more fun and engaging.
	  
	  2. A VR system that can be used in conjunction with real-life fitness equipment to provide users with a more immersive workout experience.
	  
	  3. A VR fitness app that provides users with customized workout programs based on their fitness goals and level of ability.
	  
	  4. A VR fitness game that allows users to compete against each other in virtual races or other fitness challenges.
	  
	  5. A VR system that can be used to create virtual reality environments for group fitness classes, allowing people to take part in classes from anywhere in the world.
- There's a lot more you can do, but that's enough to know for now. [See here for more information from the OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion)
- # Learning Kubernetes
- Let's start by getting an overview.
- ==Explain what kubernetes software is==
	- Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of servers. It provides a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.
- ==What is a containerized software application in the context of kubernetes ?==
	- Applications in Kubernetes are typically packaged as Docker images, which can be run in Kubernetes pods.
- ==Why is kubernetes important?==
	- Kubernetes is important because it is a portable, extensible system for managing containerized workloads and services that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a wide range of features including container orchestration, service discovery and load balancing, storage provisioning, and secrets and configuration management.
- ==What technologies are similar to kubernetes?==
	- Some technologies that are similar to Kubernetes are Apache Mesos and Docker Swarm.
- ==What are the top five most important things to know about kubernetes?==
	- 1.Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.
	  2. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. 
	  3. Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is a member of the CNCF family of projects.
	  4. Kubernetes is a production-ready platform that is constantly evolving, with new features and functionality being added on a regular basis.
	  5. Kubernetes is an open source project and contributions are welcome from anyone who wants to help.
- ==What are the components that make up kubernetes?  For example, pods, volumes, secrets==
	- Pods, Replication Controllers, Services, Volumes, Secrets, Config Maps, Jobs, Daemon Sets, and Stateful Sets
- ==Explain kubernetes pods to a programmer==
	- who is used to process-based containers
	  
	  In process-based containers, each container is isolated from the others and has its own process running inside it. This makes it easy to run multiple containers on a single host, as each container does not interfere with the others.
	  
	  Kubernetes pods are different in that they allow multiple containers to run together in a single pod. This means that the containers in a pod can share data and communicate with each other. This can be useful for microservices that need to communicate with each other.
- ==Write advanced guide to kubernetes==
	- Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that can help you streamline the process of deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. In this guide, we will take a deep dive into the features and functionality of Kubernetes, and explain how you can use it to automate the process of deploying and managing your applications.
	  
	  We will cover the following topics in this guide:
	  
	  Kubernetes Basics: An introduction to the Kubernetes toolset and how it can help you manage containerized applications at scale.
	  
	  Kubernetes Deployment Patterns: Common patterns for deploying applications on Kubernetes, including using Deployments, Jobs, and DaemonSets.
	  
	  Kubernetes Services: How to expose your applications to the outside world using Kubernetes Services.
	  
	  Kubernetes Storage: Ways to persist data generated by your applications using Kubernetes Storage Classes and Volumes.
	  
	  Kubernetes Networking: An overview of the networking features available in Kubernetes, and how you can use them to connect your applications.
	  
	  Kubernetes Security: Best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
	  
	  Kubernetes Monitoring: Recommendations for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
	  
	  Kubernetes Maintenance: How to perform common maintenance tasks for your Kubernetes cluster, such as upgrading versions and backing up data.
	  
	  By the end of this guide, you should have a good understanding of the features available in Kubernetes and how you can use them to deploy and manage your applications at scale.
- ==Write guide to Kubernetes Basics: An introduction to the Kubernetes toolset==
	- Kubernetes is a toolset used for managing containerized applications. It provides a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts. It is designed to provide strong guarantees about the ordering and co-existence of concurrent updates.
	  
	  Kubernetes is composed of a set of modules, each of which is a containerized application itself. The main modules are: 
	  
	   kube-apiserver: Provides the REST API for Kubernetes. It is the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. 
	   kube-controller-manager: Runs the Kubernetes controllers. These include the replication controller, endpoint controller, namespace controller, and service account controller. 
	   kube-scheduler: Automatically schedules containers on nodes in the cluster. 
	  kube-proxy: Provides network proxy services for the containers.
	  etcd: Stores the persistent Kubernetes cluster state.
	  
	  In addition to the main modules, Kubernetes also includes a set of supporting modules. These include: 
	  cAdvisor: Collects container performance data. 
	   kubelet: Runs containers on nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. 
	  kube-dns: Provides DNS services for the Kubernetes domain.
	  
	  Kubernetes is designed to be extensible. New modules can be added to Kubernetes to support new functionality or to replace existing modules.
- ==Write advanced guide to Kubernetes Deployment Patterns: Common patterns for deploying applications on Kubernetes, including using Deployments, Jobs, and DaemonSets.==
	- 1. Deployment Patterns
	  
	  There are several common patterns for deploying applications on Kubernetes. One popular pattern is using Deployments. Deployments allow you to define multiple replicas of your application, and then automatically deploy new versions of your application across those replicas. This can be useful for rolling out new features or bug fixes to your application.
	  
	  Another common pattern is using Jobs. Jobs allow you to run one-off tasks, such as data backups or batch processing jobs. You can define multiple jobs and have them run concurrently or sequentially.
	  
	  Finally, DaemonSets are used to deploy applications that need to run on every node in a Kubernetes cluster. This can be useful for monitoring or logging applications.
	  
	  2. Using Deployments
	  
	  To use Deployments, you first need to create a Deployment resource. This resource defines the replicas of your application that you want to deploy, as well as the container image and other configuration settings. Once you've created the Deployment resource, Kubernetes will deploy your application across the specified replicas.
	  
	  You can update the Deployment resource to change the number of replicas or other settings. Kubernetes will then automatically update your application to match the new settings.
	  
	  3. Using Jobs
	  
	  To use Jobs, you first need to create a Job resource. This resource defines the task that you want to run, as well as the container image and other configuration settings. Once you've created the Job resource, Kubernetes will run the task and then delete the resource.
	  
	  You can create multiple Job resources and have them run concurrently or sequentially. Jobs can also be run on a schedule, by using the CronJob resource.
	  
	  4. Using DaemonSets
	  
	  To use DaemonSets, you first need to create a DaemonSet resource. This resource defines the application that you want to deploy, as well as the container image and other configuration settings. Once you've created the DaemonSet resource, Kubernetes will deploy the application on every node in the cluster.
	  
	  You can update the DaemonSet resource to change the application or other settings. Kubernetes will then automatically update the application on all nodes in the cluster.
- ==Write advanced guide to Kubernetes Services: How to expose your applications to the outside world using Kubernetes Services.==
	- Kubernetes Services offer a simple and consistent way to expose your applications to the outside world. By creating a Service, you can specify which Pods should be exposed and the Port that should be used to access them. When a Service is created, Kubernetes will automatically create a DNS entry for the Service, allowing you to access the Service by its DNS name.
	  
	  To create a Service, you first need to create a definition file that specifies the details of the Service. The definition file must include a metadata section that contains a name for the Service, as well as labels that are used to identify the Service. The definition file must also include a spec section that specifies the type of Service, the selector for the Pods that should be exposed, and the Port that should be used to access the Service.
	  
	  Once you have created the definition file, you can use the kubectl create command to create the Service.
	  
	  $ kubectl create -f service.yaml
	  
	  service/my-service created
	  
	  After the Service has been created, you can use the kubectl get service command to retrieve information about the Service.
	  
	  $ kubectl get service my-service
	  
	  NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
	  
	  my-service ClusterIP 10.0.0.1 <none> 80/TCP 3s
	  
	  You can use the kubectl describe service command to retrieve even more information about a Service.
	  
	  $ kubectl describe service my-service
	  
	  Name: my-service
	  
	  Namespace: default
	  
	  Labels: <none>
	  
	  Annotations: <none>
	  
	  Selector: app=my-app
	  
	  Type: ClusterIP
	  
	  IP: 10.0.0.1
	  
	  Port: <unset> 80/TCP
	  
	  TargetPort: 80/TCP
	  
	  Endpoints: 10.1.1.1:80,10.1.1.2:80
	  
	  Session Affinity: None
	  
	  Events: <none>
	  
	  The kubectl expose command can be used to create a Service without creating a definition file. This command will create a Service with a default configuration.
	  
	  $ kubectl expose deployment my-app --port=80
	  
	  service/my-app exposed
	  
	  Kubernetes Services are a great way to expose your applications to the outside world. By creating a Service, you can specify which Pods should be exposed and the Port that should be used to access them. When a Service is created, Kubernetes will automatically create a DNS entry for the Service, allowing you to access the Service by its DNS name.
- ==write advanced guide to Kubernetes Networking: An overview of the networking features available in Kubernetes, and how you can use them to connect your applications.==
	- Kubernetes networking provides a wide variety of features and capabilities to connect your applications. In this guide, we will cover the basics of Kubernetes networking and how you can use it to connect your applications.
	  
	  Kubernetes networking is based on the Container Network Interface (CNI), which is a specification for how to configure network interfaces for containers. CNI provides a portable and extensible way to configure networking for containers. Kubernetes networking is implemented using CNI plugins, which are responsible for allocating IP addresses, routing traffic, and providing other networking services.
	  
	  Kubernetes networking can be used to provide a variety of services, including:
	  
	  IP address management: Kubernetes can allocate IP addresses for containers and track which addresses are in use. This allows you to use a single pool of IP addresses for your entire deployment, making it easy to manage and scale your applications.
	  
	  DNS service: Kubernetes can provide a DNS service for your containers, allowing them to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. This is useful for service discovery and for making your applications easier to use.
	  
	  Load balancing: Kubernetes can load balance traffic between containers using a variety of methods, such as round-robin or least-connected. This allows you to distribute traffic evenly across your application instances, ensuring that your users experience a consistent level of service.
	  
	  In addition to the services listed above, Kubernetes networking provides a number of other features, such as network policy and service mesh. These features are beyond the scope of this guide, but you can learn more about them in the Kubernetes documentation.
	  
	  Now that you understand the basics of Kubernetes networking, let's take a look at how you can use it to connect your applications.
	  
	  There are two main ways to connect applications using Kubernetes networking:
	  
	  Service objects: Service objects expose a logical set of pods as a network service. This allows you to connect to your applications using a DNS name or an IP address.
	  
	  Ingress objects: Ingress objects provide a way to route external traffic to your services. This allows you to expose your services to the internet, load balance traffic, and provide SSL termination.
	  
	  In addition to the methods described above, you can also use network policies to control traffic between your applications. Network policies allow you to specify which pods are allowed to communicate with each other. This can be used to implement security controls, such as firewalls, and to isolate different parts of your deployment.
	  
	  Now that you know the basics of Kubernetes networking, you can start using it to connect your applications. For more information, refer to the Kubernetes documentation.
- ==write advanced guide to Kubernetes Security: Best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster and applications.==
	- Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that has many features and options. While this provides great flexibility, it also means that there are many ways to configure Kubernetes. This can make it difficult to know which options are the most secure.
	  
	  In this article, we will discuss some of the best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
	  
	  1. Use Role-Based Access Control
	  
	  Role-based access control (RBAC) is a powerful security feature in Kubernetes that allows you to control who has access to what resources.
	  
	  RBAC is based on three concepts:
	  
	  Roles: A role is a set of permissions that can be assigned to a user or group.
	  
	  Subjects: A subject is a user or group that is assigned a role.
	  
	  Resources: A resource is an object that a role can be applied to, such as a pod or secret.
	  
	  You can use RBAC to control which users and groups can access which resources. For example, you could create a role that allows users to read and write to pods, but not to secrets.
	  
	  2. Use Network Segmentation
	  
	  Network segmentation is a security technique that involves dividing a network into smaller segments. This can be used to isolate different types of traffic and to limit the damage that can be caused by an attacker.
	  
	  For example, you could use network segmentation to isolate your application traffic from your database traffic. This would mean that an attacker would only be able to access your application if they could exploit a vulnerability in your application. They would not be able to directly access your database.
	  
	  3. Use TLS/SSL
	  
	  TLS/SSL is a security protocol that provides encryption and authentication. It is often used to secure communication between two systems, such as between a web server and a web browser.
	  
	  TLS/SSL can be used to secure communication between components in a Kubernetes cluster. For example, you could use TLS/SSL to secure communication between the Kubernetes API server and the Kubernetes nodes.
	  
	  4. Use a Firewall
	  
	  A firewall is a network security device that controls traffic based on a set of rules. Firewalls can be used to block traffic from certain IP addresses or to allow traffic only from certain ports.
	  
	  Firewalls can be used to control access to a Kubernetes cluster. For example, you could use a firewall to allow only traffic from the Kubernetes API server to the Kubernetes nodes.
	  
	  5. Use Identity and Access Management
	  
	  Identity and access management (IAM) is a security technique that allows you to control who has access to what resources. IAM can be used to control access to a Kubernetes cluster.
	  
	  For example, you could use IAM to allow only certain users to have access to the Kubernetes API server.
	  
	  6. Use Security Policies
	  
	  Security policies are a set of rules that defines what actions are allowed or not allowed. Security policies can be used to control access to a Kubernetes cluster.
	  
	  For example, you could use a security policy to allow only certain users to have access to the Kubernetes API server.
	  
	  7. Use Security Groups
	  
	  Security groups are a way to control access to a Kubernetes cluster. Security groups can be used to allow or deny traffic from certain IP addresses or subnets.
	  
	  For example, you could use a security group to allow only traffic from the Kubernetes API server to the Kubernetes nodes.
	  
	  8. Use a VPN
	  
	  A VPN is a private network that uses a public network, such as the Internet, to connect remote sites or users together. VPNs can be used to secure communication between a Kubernetes cluster and external clients.
	  
	  For example, you could use a VPN to secure communication between the Kubernetes API server and external clients.
	  
	  Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that has many features and options. While this provides great flexibility, it also means that there are many ways to configure Kubernetes. This can make it difficult to know which options are the most secure.
	  
	  In this article, we have discussed some of the best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster and applications. We have also discussed some of the trade-offs that you need to consider when choosing security options.
- ==write guide to Kubernetes Monitoring: Recommendations for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster and applications.==
	- Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration tool that helps you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. While Kubernetes offers a lot of features and benefits, it can be challenging to monitor and troubleshoot a Kubernetes cluster and the applications running on it. In this article, we will recommend some of the best practices for monitoring your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
	  
	  1. Use a dedicated monitoring solution
	  
	  Kubernetes itself does not include a built-in monitoring solution, so it is important to use a dedicated monitoring solution that is specifically designed for monitoring Kubernetes clusters. We recommend using a solution like Prometheus, which is an open-source monitoring solution that is popular in the Kubernetes community. Prometheus offers many features that are specifically designed for monitoring Kubernetes clusters, such as the ability to scrape metrics from Kubernetes API objects and to automatically discover and monitor Kubernetes pods.
	  
	  2. Collect metrics from all Kubernetes components
	  
	  To effectively monitor a Kubernetes cluster, it is important to collect metrics from all of the major Kubernetes components, such as the API server, scheduler, and kubelet. These metrics can help you to troubleshoot issues with individual Kubernetes components, as well as to understand the overall health of your cluster.
	  
	  3. Collect application-level metrics
	  
	  In addition to collecting metrics from Kubernetes components, it is also important to collect application-level metrics from the applications running on your Kubernetes cluster. These metrics can help you to troubleshoot issues with individual applications, as well as to understand the overall health of your applications.
	  
	  4. Use Grafana for metric visualization
	  
	  Grafana is a popular open-source metric visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus. We recommend using Grafana to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus, as it offers many features specifically designed for visualizing Kubernetes metrics.
	  
	  5. Use alerts to notify you of problems
	  
	  It is important to setup alerts to notify you when there are problems with your Kubernetes cluster or applications. Alerts can be sent via email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other notification channels. We recommend using a solution like Alertmanager, which is an open-source alerting solution that integrates with Prometheus.
	  
	   following these recommendations will help you to effectively monitor your Kubernetes cluster and applications, and to troubleshoot problems when they occur.
- ==Write example of kubernetes pod yaml files==
	- ```yaml 
	  yaml mypod.yaml
	  apiVersion: v1
	  kind: Pod
	  metadata:
	    name: mypod
	    labels:
	      app: myapp
	  spec:
	    containers:
	    -name: mycontainer
	      image: busybox
	      command: ["echo", "hello world"]`
	  ```
- ==Write tutorial on how to deploy nodejs application on kubenetes==
	- In this tutorial, we will learn how to deploy a Node.js application on a Kubernetes cluster. We will be using the Minikube Kubernetes distribution.
	  
	  Before we begin, make sure that you have the following installed on your workstation:
	  -Minikube
	  -kubectl
	  -Docker
	  
	  Now let's get started!
	  
	  1. Create a new file called `app.js` and add the following code to it:
	  
	  ```javascript
	  console.log('Hello, world!');
	  ```
	  
	  2. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` and add the following code to it:
	  
	  ```dockerfile
	  FROM node:10
	  
	  WORKDIR /app
	  
	  COPY app.js .
	  
	  CMD ["node", "app.js"]
	  ```
	  
	  3. Build the Docker image by running the following command:
	  
	  ```bash
	  $ docker build -t my-node-app .
	  ```
	  
	  4. Start Minikube:
	  
	  ```bash
	  $ minikube start
	  ```
	  
	  5. Run the Docker image in a Kubernetes pod:
	  
	  ```bash
	  $ kubectl run my-node-app --image=my-node-app --image-pull-policy=Never
	  ```
	  
	  6. Expose the pod as a Kubernetes service:
	  
	  ```bash
	  $ kubectl expose pod my-node-app --type=NodePort
	  ```
	  
	  7. Determine the service's NodePort:
	  
	  ```bash
	  $ kubectl describe service my-node-app | grep NodePort
	  ```
	  
	  8. Access the application in your browser at `http://<Minikube IP>:<NodePort>`
- ==How should I host kubernetes in production?==
	- There are a number of ways to host Kubernetes in production. One way is to use a managed service, such as Google Container Engine or Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes. Alternatively, you can install Kubernetes on premise using tools such as Kubeadm.
- ==Write tutorial on how to set up kubernetes on aws==
	- Setting up Kubernetes on AWS
	  
	  Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration tool for deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. It is one of the most popular container orchestration platforms and is supported by major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
	  
	  In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using the open-source project Kubernetes-The-Hard-Way (KTHW). This project provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a highly-available Kubernetes cluster without using a cloud-provided Kubernetes service such as EKS or GKE.
	  
	  We will cover the following topics in this tutorial:
	  
	  Why use Kubernetes?
	  
	  Prerequisites
	  
	  Creating an AWS VPC
	  
	  Launching AWS EC2 Instances
	  
	  Configuring Security Groups
	  
	  Configuring DNS
	  
	  Generating SSL Certificates
	  
	  Deploying Kubernetes
	  
	  Testing the Kubernetes Cluster
	  
	  Why use Kubernetes?
	  
	  Kubernetes is a powerful orchestration tool that can automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is one of the most popular container orchestration platforms and is supported by major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
	  
	  Kubernetes can improve the efficiency of your development and operations teams by automating the management of your application deployments. It can also help you to save money by more efficiently using your cloud resources.
	  
	  Prerequisites
	  
	  In order to follow this tutorial, you will need the following:
	  
	  An AWS account. If you don't have one, you can create one here.
	  
	  A basic understanding of containerized applications and Kubernetes.
	  
	  Creating an AWS VPC
	  
	  We will start by creating an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) which will be used to launch our EC2 instances.
	  
	  1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the VPC Dashboard.
	  
	  2. Click on "Your VPCs" in the left-hand menu and then click on the "Create VPC" button.
	  
	  3. Enter a name for your VPC (e.g. "Kubernetes VPC") and set the IPv4 CIDR block to "10.0.0.0/16".
