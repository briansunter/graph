- # Brian Sunter's Notes
	- These are my notes on a variety of subjects, like a personal wikipedia. I think of it as a "Knowledge Graph", "Second Brain", or "Digital Garden".
- ## What is this site?
	- I use note-taking for learning new subjects and managing projects. Publishing my notes encourages me to improve my notes to the point where they're understandable to someone else.

	- Unlike a traditional blog, these are not long posts in chronological order. These are short, highly networked fragments of information and summaries. I use the features of my note taking program to recombine notes from other pages.
- ## Why am I doing this?
	- I also hope to connect with others that have similar interests, learn from them, and share what I've learned and how I learned it. Everyone takes notes in such a unique way and I enjoy learning from others workflows.
