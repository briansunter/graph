	- 3📌 The ABCDE Framework
	  
	  Use it to prioritize effectively.
	  
	  What would happen if you forgot to pick up your son at school?
	  
	  It would be a stressful situation.
	  
	  Therefore...
	  
	  ➜ "Pick up Derek" =  [A] task.
	  
	  ♦️Never do a lower cat. task before completing a higher one.

	- 4📌 The Keystone Habit
	  
	  ♦️If you don't get your Keystone habit done, everything falls apart.
	  
	  Instead of focusing on multiple things at the same time,
	  
	  pick a keystone habit and do your VERY BEST to get it done consistently. 
	  
	  ➜ The rest will take care of itself.

	- 6📌 The Landscape of Commitments
	  
	  ♦️ Having a lot of projects and to-do's can quickly make your life overwhelming.
	  
	   And sometimes it's not possible to cut down.
	  
	  ➜ In that case, group them ALL together on a big landscape of commitments.
	  
	  More clarity = Less stress.

	- 7📌 Chunking
	  
	  Some individual tasks can be tedious.
	  
	  ♦️ But batch them together as in a routine and they will become more instinctive.
	  
	  Chunking can help you automate your processes.
	  
	  ➜ Group together activities you know you can tackle in sequence.

	- 8📌 Buffer Time
	  
	  How many times your schedule overlaps?
	  
	  This is commonly due to poor planning.
	  
	  ♦️ But sometimes you just can't predict how your day will unfold.
	  
	  ➜ To make sure you're on top of things, add some buffer time in between your activities.

	- 9📌 Theme Work
	  
	  Multitasking heavy lifts can result in serious inefficiency.
	  
	  ♦️ When handling big projects, make sure your utmost focus goes to 1 important category only on any given day.
	  
	  ➜ Theme your days to canalise your focus, and attack one important category per day only.

	- 10📌 The Habit Threshold
	  
	  Habits are hard to develop.
	  
	  Studies show the average time needed to drill in a new habit is 20 days.
	  
	  ♦️ That is your Habit Threshold. 
	  
	  ➜ Whenever you implement a new habit, ALWAYS start with a 22 -23 day challenge, no less.
