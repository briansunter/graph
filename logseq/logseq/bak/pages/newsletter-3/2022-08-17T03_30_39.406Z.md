# Summary and Reflection 🤔
- This week I wrote a few [guides](https://briansunter.com/graph/?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#/page/logseq-getting-started) on using Logseq and how to set up a public notes site like [mine](https://briansunter.com/graph/?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#/page/newsletter-3). I released a [new plugin](https://github.com/briansunter/logseq-get-youtube-captions?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) to download captions from YouTube directly into your notes to help you study videos. I also include some productivity tips and fun artwork created by OpenAI’s DALL-E image generation technology.
# Updates 🆕
	- ## [[get-youtube-subtitles]]
		- My [get-youtube-captions plugin](https://github.com/briansunter/logseq-get-youtube-captions?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) launched in the Logseq marketplace. You can use this tool to pull the captions from a YouTube video into your notes. Just search for “get-youtube-captions” in the Logseq marketplace to install it.
		- There is a lot of good content on YouTube, but I find it hard to remember. This plugin helps you study videos and works well for podcasts on YouTube.
		- The plugin inserts all spoken words from the video as text directly underneath the video link in your notes.

		-
		- Feeding the captions text into my [[logseq openai]] plugin works incredibly well to summarize the video and clean up the wording of the captions. I use it to get a summary of a video before deciding to watch it too

	- ## [[omnivore-logseq-guide]]
		- If you read a lot of content online, you need a “read it later app” so you can save interesting links, then read and highlight everything all at once. Keeping the article for later is much more efficient than reading a link as soon as you find it.
		- I recently discovered a terrific “Read it Later” app with a built-in Reader Mode and highlighter called [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
		- The [Omnivore web app and backend are open-source](https://github.com/omnivore-app/logseq-omnivore?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), so you know you can use it free forever, just like Logseq. Omnivore provides a free hosted option too.
		- This is a screenshot in the Omnivore reader view with my highlights:
		- {{tweet https://twitter.com/Bsunter/status/1539118080944656386?s=20&t=uY4RVPFUitMRJZBYRxziBw}}
		- The highlighter in reader mode is essential.

	- ## [[logseq-social]]
		- Logseq social was a quick idea I had one night when setting up the about me page on my public graph.
		- I wanted to make it easier for users to learn about me and to showcase other cool graphs on my profile. I also wanted to discover new ones through others profiles. I want to make something like a modern "link ring" or "blog roll".
		- My thought process went like this:
			- I need to set up an about me page for my public graph so people know who I am
			- Instead of choosing a random page name, I make a page at a known location in my graph called `[[logseq-social/profile]]`
			- Instead of just writing plain text, I use logseq properties to add a little bit of structure. This means I add properties like `logseq-social/name:: bsunter logseq-social/public-graph:: https://briansunter.com[/](https://briansunter.com/graph%60)graph[`](https://briansunter.com/graph%60) to my profile page
		- This allows me have a nice about me profile page and display a list of interesting graphs for others to explore. It also helps my graph get discovered by making my profile easily shareable by others on their profiles.
		- In the future, it would be cool to search others graphs and have a plugin to make the social features easier. Lots of interesting features could be built on this simple idea.
		- I'm really excited by the people who set this up already!

	- ## [[logseq-getting-started]]
		- Logseq is still in beta, so there aren't very many "getting started" guides, especially for nontechnical users.
		- I [wrote a quick guide](https://briansunter.com/graph/#/page/omnivore-logseq-guide) on how you can get started with logseq and share your notes online in just 30 minutes.
		- I go over the bare minimum to install logseq and make a public website like mine with a hosting company called Netlify. I'm hoping this will help anyone reading this newsletter who hasn't tried logseq yet or wants to follow along with some of my note taking.
		- All you need to do is download logseq from github and upload your site to Netlify. [I go over it in detail in this guide.](https://briansunter.com/graph/#/page/logseq-getting-started) I highly recommend buying a domain.
- # Productivity Toolkit 🛠️
	- I highly recommend [Tiago Forte’s book Building a Second Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential-ebook/dp/B09LVVN9L3/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=&utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)as an introduction to the whole note-taking and “second brain” movement.
	- It’s notable because it’s both a productivity book and a book on personal knowledge management. It shows how you can organize your knowledge to do/produce valuable things. I read so much stuff and forget it; the stuff I read doesn’t always lead to a beneficial outcome in my life.
	- This book expresses a lot of my favorite ideas from my favorite books like [Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1D3GB109D9S16&keywords=getting%20things%20done&qid=1655938205&sprefix=getting%20things%20done%2Caudible%2C116&sr=8-3&utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/B09HSSFCPR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7OPNPUO12FGE&keywords=how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes&qid=1655938233&sprefix=how%20to%20take%20smart%20note%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-1&utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter), as well as a lot of Tiago’s ideas from his blog like [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).
	- He explains these abstract “workflows for your life” in a tool-agnostic way with good terminology.
	- The main workflow is a four-step process called [CODE](https://www.keepproductive.com/blog/how-to-build-a-second-brain?utm_campaign=%F0%9F%A7%A0%20%20A%20software%20engineer%27s%20approach%20to%20learning&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter) which he goes over in detail in his book.
		- **C**- Capture
		- **O**- Organize
		- **D**- Distill
		- **E**- Express

# Brain Food 🧠
	- ## Quote
		- The biggest question when starting notetaking is how to organize your notes and especially what to turn into backlinks.
		- This is a quote from one of my favorite books  [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/B09HSSFCPR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=7OPNPUO12FGE&keywords=how+to+take+smart+notes&qid=1655938233&sprefix=how+to+take+smart+note%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-1) by Dr. Sönke Ahrens
		- > The archivist asks which keyword is the most fitting. The writer asks under which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note again, even if I forget it?
		- Are you a writer or just an archivist?
		- When taking notes, we should always think in the back of our minds about how we’ll use the note in the future. In particular, what situation or context we will be in where we need the note.
		- When making a backlink, think more about how you’ll use the note and how the new note relates to your existing notes than trying to “categorize” the note perfectly.

	- ## Link of the week
		- Have you seen [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) by OpenAI? It's an AI that can create an image of anything you ask, and generate a completely original picture. It's a website with a text box. You type the scene you want to see in the box, and the AI generates an image. It's made by the same company as gpt3.
		- Right now, only a few people have access, but it will be more widely available soon.
		- Soon, you will see stuff like DALL-E and GPT-3 everywhere. All entertainment content will use some level of AI generation soon.
		- You can imagine one of the potentials for the "multiverse" is to generate tons and tons of content like this using AI.

	- Most of the use cases I've seen for DALL-e are making artwork, and it's even better at this than the photorealistic stuff.
