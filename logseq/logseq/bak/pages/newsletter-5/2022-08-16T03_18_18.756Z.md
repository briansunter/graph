# Summary and Reflection 🤔
	- I'm starting a 3(+) month-long ["Algorithms Boot Camp"]([[algorithms-boot-camp]]). I've been collecting notes on this topic for some time.
	- I'll include a note related to one of the topics in the [curriculum here]([[algorithms-boot-camp]]) for the next few months as a part of the newsletter. I'll continue to share other types of content too.
	  id:: 62cb3582-320f-49c2-911d-71833206c08f
	- I'm sharing my logseq [[comparison-template]]. This simple framework will help you make the best decision between different options.
	  id:: 62cb3582-b8e9-4790-b45d-973c7b7e7b19
	- This week, I'm sharing some research around my latest project: improving my sleep quality.
	- I also found some interesting perspectives on the Elon Musk Twitter Controversy.
# Updates 🆕
	- [[algorithms-boot-camp]]
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1657488579000_0.png)
		- [This]([[algorithms-boot-camp]]) is the 3-month curriculum for the [[algorithms-boot-camp]].
		- It's a weekly series of guides that will help beginner and intermediate programmers learn the basics of algorithms.
		- Hopefully, my process for making the guide and annotating code in logseq will also be interesting to non-programmers.
		- I wrote a [comprehensive outline of all the algorithms I plan to learn]([[data-structures-algorithms-guide]]). This "boot camp" project will build up this outline as a series of guides one week at a time.
		- I'm not writing this guide from an expert's perspective but rather from a student's perspective. I'll be learning along with you and solidifying my own knowledge.
		- Feel free to [correct me, make suggestions, and ask questions on Twitter.](https://twitter.com/Bsunter) This guide is a living document; hopefully, a community of like-minded people will benefit from it.

# Productivity Toolkit 🛠️
	- In this section, I'll share a productivity tip I've learned recently.
	  id:: 62cb3582-7742-4ba4-8145-84ef192cbc23
	- ## [[comparison-template]]
		- The "pros/cons" template is a good way to compare two or more items.
		- When researching something, I'll use this template to compare the pros and cons of different options.
		- This helps me to decide which option is the best fit for my needs.
		- I created a [comparison template]([[comparison-template]]) in Logseq for this purpose.
		- Feel free to copy this and adapt it to your own needs.
# Brain Food 🧠
	- In this section, I'll share some interesting articles and "food for thought."
	- ## Quote
		- The Huberman Show is my favorite health and science podcast.
		- I enjoyed his podcast called [Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake](https://hubermanlab.com/master-your-sleep-and-be-more-alert-when-awake/)
		- {{tweet https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1438316907598258177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1438316907598258177%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fhubermanlab.com%2Ftoolkit-for-sleep%2F}}
		- I value feeling alert and rested almost more than anything, but I still have trouble sleeping well consistently. Mostly because I refuse to go to sleep when I get tired.
		  id:: 62cb3582-9487-46aa-8aed-b8220c73eda8
		- I thought this episode had many actionable science-based tips on how to sleep better.
		  id:: 62cb3582-368c-492c-a4b2-234968218be4
		- The most interesting part was the in-depth discussion of "Circadian Rhythm", the 24-hour cycle that controls when you feel sleepy.
		- There are lots of "hacks" you can do to adjust when you naturally wake up and feel sleepy. Here are a few from the episode:
		  id:: 62cb3582-f39a-4b6b-bd81-6c640e945cab
		- #### Sleep Tips
			- View sunlight by going outside within 30-60 minutes of waking. Do that again in the late afternoon, before sunset.
			- Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy.
			- Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime
			- Avoid viewing bright lights between 10 pm and 4 am
			- Sleep at a cold temperature around 65F (18C)
		- This week, I'm making an extra effort to get direct sunlight early in the morning and going to bed as soon as I feel tired, even if there's a lot more I'd like to do.

	- ## Link of the week
		- Everyone has been talking about Elon Musk buying Twitter and the controversy around the "spam users."
		- Elon Musk recently signed a deal to buy Twitter.
		  id:: 62cb3582-1352-40dd-8479-af9cd21743cb
		- [This week, he released a letter saying he was terminating the deal.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm)
		- Twitter is saying they are suing to make the deal go through.
		- {{tweet https://twitter.com/btaylor/status/1545526087089696768?s=20&t=dzE8WKj4vKNRyITa0ueV2Q}}
		- He claims that Twitter isn't providing him with good enough data that was agreed on to determine how many "spam" accounts were on the platform.
		  id:: 62cb3582-c5d2-46a2-a975-abc0521c062a
		- On one hand, if Elon Musk has buyer remorse after Twitter's stock dropped, it's easy to say the data isn't "good" enough, no matter how much or what it is.
		  id:: 62cb3582-a155-4205-90a8-ae5cce290062
		- However, there's so much data that even people inside these companies struggle to manage it. It would be tough for an outsider to validate the data fully. He might want to have clarified that before the deal, but maybe Twitter wouldn't have provided it otherwise
		  id:: 62cb3582-f314-49d1-9e44-80046ea6d965
		- I think people will be arguing about this data in court for a long time.
		- Also, there is a huge conflict of interest and incentive for Twitter to overrepresent how many active users it has.
		  id:: 62cb3582-9dc3-4be1-8647-89edd78bf894
		- You could imagine how Twitter would be incentivized to report spam users as real users in growth metrics and let spam users click on ads Twitter charges.
		  id:: 62cb3582-d476-4fff-af87-cd72a7c02e48
		- I'm not saying this is intentional, but from an organizational standpoint you could be incentivized to look the other way or prioritize different initiatives than fighting spam if money is coming in from spam accounts.
		  id:: 62cb35ef-120d-4887-9ba8-ba65d523bd75
		- I'll be following how this plays out in court and if anything surprising about the spam accounts surfaces in court.
		  id:: 62cb3582-57f6-442b-bfff-61f6eacf05b0
		- ### Here's some interesting takes from [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32027341):
		- > It's somewhat hilarious to think that even if Twitter were to settle modestly for $5bn, that would be more than double of all profit that Twitter has ever generated as a company.
			- [ckastner](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32032313)
		- id:: 62cb3582-1669-44e9-ab72-fe8eacf0e753
		  > Wasn’t Google Ads 80% fake clicks on some studies? It won’t be surprising Twitter Ads is actually worse. There is so zero incentive to clean it up and so many shady reasons to do it.
			- [hartator](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32037312)
		- id:: 62cb3582-8e73-49a9-9f5a-9c8832454bcd
		  > A fun side effect of all of this: if you believe in the court's ability to force Musk to buy Twitter, you should continue to buy up stock until it reaches the price Musk agreed to pay for it.
			- - [mabbo](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32040210)
		- id:: 62cb3582-f053-486a-94a8-38bc95bb47c8
		  > This is absolutely pure speculation, but perhaps that is Musk's motive for this whole charade. He is erratic enough that it certainly seems possible that he did this whole acquisition agreement with no intention of following through simply to unveil information to discredit Twitter. It certainly doesn't appear from the outside that Musk had any ideas for making money on this by materially improving Twitter as a business from anything I've read. The justifications about free speech seem to taint this deal with Musk having an ideological bent to the whole transaction, so it seems possible that he thought he could use the buyout to access damaging information (like potentially lying on SEC filings) and then back out without spending the full amount.

		  > I am reminded of Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, in which a significant plot point was a hostile buyer using due diligence as a kind of DoS attack on the protagonist's company.

		  > This article says Musk agreed to buy Twitter mostly as a joke. I think there's a far better explanation. This wasn't a joke for Musk because after agreeing to buy Twitter he proceeded to sell billions of dollars' worth of TSLA stock, supposedly to finance the purchase. Even for the richest man in the world that's not a joke.
		- > I think a better explanation is that Musk offered to buy Twitter as a cover for selling billions of dollars' worth of TSLA.
		- > Look at this storyThe headline is: "Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter"
		- id:: 62cb36a2-d304-4636-acee-6f63d83afb69
		  > Why does he need a cover? Because TSLA is way too overvalued. He has to know that it is overvalued. Tesla's market cap is double of Toyota, VW, Mercedes, BMW, GM, Honda, Ferrari and Volvo all combined! [1]. If you sell stock while knowing your company's stock is way too overvalued, you're fleecing unsophisticated investors. Pretending to buy Twitter provides a convenient cover.
		- > Musk pretended that TSLA valuation is reasonable. Musk even called out Gates for shorting TSLA stock [2]. If he didn't have a cover then Musk would look like a hypocrite for selling TSLA.
		- id:: 62cb36ae-e468-4136-b442-e16bb5c90c32
		  > In reality, both Musk and Gates sold TSLA, the only difference is that Musk sold stocks he owned, but Gates sold borrowed stocks. But Musk used buying Twitter as a cover, so he gets to pretend to be morally superior. Even though both men sold TSLA, according to Musk, Gates' sales means that he isn't serious about climate change [3].
