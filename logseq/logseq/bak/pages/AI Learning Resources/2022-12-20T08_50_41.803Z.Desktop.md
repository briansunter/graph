- # Overview
	- I'm very eager to get into Artificial Intelligence (AI), but with so much to learn, I'm not sure where to start. Do I need a lot of math? What kind? Which areas should I focus on? How can I make sense of all the topics? What tools should I use? Additionally, how is the field developing, and what direction is it headed in?
	- I'm a software engineer with some math under my belt, and my goal is to gain a thorough understanding of AI so I can apply it to my work. I'm particularly interested in generative AI, natural language processing, and building intelligent agents. I also want to gain the necessary math skills to have a strong understanding of the fundamentals, but I don't want to too bogged down in some of the advanced mathematical details.
	- To help me on this journey, I've collected and summarized the best courses and books to help me get started on the right foot
	- I plan to study some of the following AI learning resources and this site will be a record of my successes and failures. I hope you'll join me on this journey as I learn more about this ever-evolving field.

# An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic
- ![0521775019.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_.jpg](../assets/0521775019.01._SCLZZZZZZZ_SX500_1671236538109_0.jpg)
- [Book Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521775019?tag=bsunter06-20)
- Book focused on probability and logic from a philosophical rather than mathemetical perspective.
- The book has been designed to offer maximal accessibility to the widest range of students (not only those majoring in philosophy) and assumes no formal training in elementary symbolic logic. It offers a comprehensive course covering all basic definitions of induction and probability, and considers such topics as decision theory, Bayesianism, frequency ideas, and the philosophical problem of induction.

- ## Mike Jordan Book list
	- Extremely rigorous books recommend by Mike Jordan from Berkeley intended for those focused on research. I will probably never read these and feels impossible to get through these in one lifetime.
	- [Hackernews Comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1055389)
	- > Esentially all of the material in the following intermediate-level statistics book:
	- 1.) Casella, G. and Berger, R.L. (2001). "Statistical Inference" Duxbury Press.
	- > For a slightly more advanced book that's quite clear on mathematical techniques, the following book is quite good:
	- 2.) Ferguson, T. (1996). "A Course in Large Sample Theory" Chapman & Hall/CRC.
	- > You'll need to learn something about asymptotics at some point, and a good starting place is:
	- 3.) Lehmann, E. (2004). "Elements of Large-Sample Theory" Springer.
	- > Those are all frequentist books. You should also read something Bayesian:
	- 4.) Gelman, A. et al. (2003). "Bayesian Data Analysis" Chapman & Hall/CRC.
	- > you should start to read about Bayesian computation:
	- 5.) Robert, C. and Casella, G. (2005). "Monte Carlo Statistical Methods" Springer.
	- > On the probability front, a good intermediate text is:
	- 6.) Grimmett, G. and Stirzaker, D. (2001). "Probability and Random Processes" Oxford.
	- > At a more advanced level, a very good text is the following:
	- 7.) Pollard, D. (2001). "A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability" Cambridge.
	- > The standard advanced textbook is Durrett, R. (2005). "Probability: Theory and Examples" Duxbury.
	- > Machine learning research also reposes on optimization theory. A good starting book on linear optimization that will prepare you for convex optimization:
	- 8.) Bertsimas, D. and Tsitsiklis, J. (1997). "Introduction to Linear Optimization" Athena.
	- > And then you can graduate to:
	- 9.) Boyd, S. and Vandenberghe, L. (2004). "Convex Optimization" Cambridge.
	- > Getting a full understanding of algorithmic linear algebra is also important. At some point you should feel familiar with most of the material in
	- 10.) Golub, G., and Van Loan, C. (1996). "Matrix Computations" Johns Hopkins.
	- > It's good to know some information theory. The classic is:
	- 11.) Cover, T. and Thomas, J. "Elements of Information Theory" Wiley.
	- > Finally, if you want to start to learn some more abstract math, you might want to start to learn some functional analysis (if you haven't already). Functional analysis is essentially linear algebra in infinite dimensions, and it's necessary for kernel methods, for nonparametric Bayesian methods, and for various other topics. Here's a book that I find very readable:
	- 12.) Kreyszig, E. (1989). "Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications" Wiley.
