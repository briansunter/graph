- INSTRUCTIONS:
  
  **Roadhouse Rolls (around 65-68% hydration):**
	- Preheat oven to 375F
	- In a medium-size pot, over medium-high, add the milk, bring it to a boil, cut the heat, pour it into a bowl, and cool it down over an ice bath. Once it cooled down, add 120g. of filtered water, heat it to 95F, and add the yeast, dissolve, and reserve.
	- In a stand mixer bowl, add the flour, sugar,  salt, and diastatic malt powder; this last ingredient is optional. (helps with color and flavor)
	- Using the hook attachment, add in a string the melted butter (not hot) and mix; once it is incorporated, add the milk and two whole eggs. Mix until the dough does not stick to the sides of the bowl.
	- Take your dough out, form a ball, place it into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise for one to one and a half hours at room temperature or until it doubles its size.
	- Take off the plastic wrap and punch your dough, pour it out on a floured surface, cut your dough into 40 even pieces, shape them into balls by maintaining board contact constantly.
	- Place them on a lined sheet tray, cover it with plastic wrap, and let them proof for twenty minutes. Then, take the wrap off, spray them with water and immediately pop them in the oven for 15 to 18 min.
	- Brush each one of the buns with melted butter, and sprinkle some smoked flaky salt on top.
- **Charred Cinnamon Honey Butter:**
	- Using a blow torch, char three cinnamon sticks on both sizes. Let them cool down, break them into small pieces, blend them until you get a fine powder, and pass it through a sifter.
	- Place the softened butter, salt, a black pepper pinch, two teaspoons of charred cinnamon powder, a bit of freshly grated nutmeg, and the beans of half a vanilla bean pod in a mixing bowl and give it a good whisk until smooth. Add the powder sugar, and whisk vigorously to incorporate some air.
	- Add and incorporate honey (optional).
