	- Start by placing a cast iron pan into a cold oven and begin preheating to 400F.
	- In a small pot, add and melt the butter over medium heat.
	- Once the butter has browned, add in fresh sage and thyme. Stir around then place into a container and set to the side.
	- In a medium-size bowl, add and whisk together all the dry ingredients.
	- In a separate bowl, combine and whisk together the eggs then whisk in the buttermilk.
	- Remove the herbs from the browned butter and slowly whisk in the butter into the buttermilk mixture.
	- Whisk wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until well combined.
	- Remove the pan from the oven, spray with oil, and add in the batter spreading out evenly to the walls of the pan.
	- Place back into the oven for 20-25 minutes.
	- Remove and let cool for a few minutes before removing from the pan and placing onto a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
