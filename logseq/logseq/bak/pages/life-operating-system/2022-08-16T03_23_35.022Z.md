- Most of what I do in logseq is centered around "projects"
- # Intro to my task management system
	- I categorize my tasks into four categories:
		- ## routine
			- Routine tasks I have tasks I have scheduled every day, like exercise, cooking, or chores. I use recurring scheduled tasks for these
				- Example: My daily warmup routine
				- It shows up with a link to the embedded warmup video routine each day, then is hidden when I check it off, until the next day.
				- I have similar tasks that repeat at different intervals, for example, every few weeks a todo shows up on my daily notes telling me to schedule a haircut.
				- ```
				  - LATER [[5 minute morning warmup]] [[mobility]]
				  SCHEDULED: <2022-06-05 Sun .+1d>
				  ```
		- ## adhoc
			- Adhoc tasks are small random tasks that pop up, like responding to an email
				- There are lots of good tools for capturing and organizing these with queries in logseq
				- Just get everything in daily notes, tag it, and query it later.
				- `TODO Respond to [[Eric Smith]] [[email]]`
		- ## Long Term Goals
			- These are my most ambitious goals that take months or years long effort.
			- I reflect on these and my values each year as a part of my yearly planning
			- These aren't traditional "SMART" goals, they're meant to set my vision of what a great life could realistically look like. Sometimes they'll be completed, but I always like having a north star to strive for.
			- Some examples of values are: having a great group of friends, improving my relationship, becoming financially independent, being physically strong, learning new things
			- Some examples long term goals related to these values would be starting a business, buying a house, starting a family, etc.
		- ## Short term projects
			- Projects are anything that requires more than a few hours or few steps to complete, typically these are 1-3 months for me, but can be as short as a few days.
			- These are basically traditional SMART goals.
			- I try to attach each project to a long term goal or value it supports.
			- For example, a project could be to get my newsletter to 100 subscribers.
			- This seems like an achievable goal for a few months, where I can try some things and see if they work.
			- Each project has to have these things
				- End Criteria: Can I consider this "done"?
				- Time bound: Must have a deadline, even if I adjust it later
				- Mid point check in: half way between the start date and end date. I evaluate how things are going, and adjust the deadline as needed.
				  Expected outcome: What metric do I want to improve.
- # Project Template
	- I have a logseq template to help me quickly generate new projects. Feel free to copy it here [[project-template]]
		- {{embed [[project-template]]}}
	- ## Tour of the [[project-template]]
		- Heres an examples for my [[100 newsletter subscribers]] project
		- ### Project Page Properties
			- I have a number of properties in the project template to help me query it later
			- milestone date is a half way mark to re-evaluate the project and adjust the desired end date if need be
			- metrics are tags for anything quantifiable, like twitter followers.
		- ``` clojure
		  name::
		  tags::[[project]] #project-template
		  start-date::
		  milestone-date::
		  desired-end-date::
		  metrics::
		  mtype:: project
		  ```
- # Working on projects
	- Most of my time and focus is on my projects
	- After I do the things I have to do (adhoc tasks and daily routine) I spend focused time on my projects
	- I try to limit the number of projects I have going on at a given time (work in progress)
	- If you only have a few hours of free time per day, you can only have so many projects, assuming you work on them 30 minutes to 2 hours per day per project. Think about how much free time you have.
	- I usually don't work on the same project two days in a row. I like variety.
	- I use the Pomodoro method as often as possible. I set a time for 30 minutes or so and focus hard on a project, the take a break. The more focused sessions I can get in per day the better.
