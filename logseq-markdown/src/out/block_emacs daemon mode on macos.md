# Emacs Deamon Mode on macos

A common complaint about emacs is that it takes longer to launch than vim. I enjoyed being able to quickly edit a file without leaving the terminal in vim and wanted to know if there was a way to make emacs load just as fast. I have many emacs plugins through [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/), and it does take around 10-20 seconds to launch in both terminal and GUI mode. With emacs client mode, it launches in less than a second.
## Emacs client and Server

Instead of launching a full emacs client every time you want to edit a file, it's better to launch emacs as a daemon in headless mode when your computer starts up. If an emacs process is already running, you can connect to it using the `emacsclient` command.
## `emacsclient` and `emacsclient -c`

`emacsclient` launches a terminal client to a local emacs process and launches just as quickly as vim.

`emacsclient -c` opens a separate GUI instance.



## `launchd` and macos [Launch Agents](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html "Launch Agents")

If we frequently use emacs, we can have the macOS process manager start an emacs daemon on login and restart it if the daemon dies.
## LaunchAgent.plist
Create this file in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/gnu.emacs.daemon.plist`
``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
 <plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>gnu.emacs.daemon</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/local/bin/emacs</string>
    <string>--daemon</string>
  </array>
 <key>RunAtLoad</key>
 <true/>
 <key>ServiceDescription</key>
 <string>Gnu Emacs Daemon</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```






## `launchctl` load on startup

This command will start the deamon and ensure it is started on every login.
``` bash
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/gnu.emacs.daemon.plist
```

You can also use `unload` to stop the daemon and prevent it from starting next login.


### Load

`launchctl load -w <path>` loads and starts the process while also marking the process as "not disabled." The process will restart on the next login/reboot.

### Unload

`launchctl unload -w <path>` stops and unloads and disables the process. The process will NOT restart on the next login/restart.
## `emacsclient`

Now that we have a daemon always running, we can quickly launch emacs by running `emacsclient -c` or `emacsclient`. It should be restarted automatically if we ever need to kill the emacs daemon.
