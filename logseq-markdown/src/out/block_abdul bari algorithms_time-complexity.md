## Priori Analysis

Hardware independent
Theoretical


Language independent
Time and space function

## Posteriori

Watch time and bytes

# Algorithm Characteristics

{{video https://youtu.be/FbYzBWdhMb0}}
## Input

Algorithms can take 0 or more inputs
## Output

Algorithms must generate some result or output
If it doesn't give you any output, an algorithm is not useful
Even if a function returns void, it should return a result in some other method, like modifying a variable somewhere



## Definiteness

Everything should be unambiguous and clear.
If you can't describe the problem to a human, you don't know it well enough to write an algorithm.
You can't pass an imaginary number like $\sqrt{-1}$ without specifying how to deal with it




## Finiteness

Algorithms must terminate at some point

A web server, which keeps running until you stop it, is a program, not an algorithm. Programs may use algorithms while running.

## Effectiveness

Don't have any unnecessary procedures in your algorithm.

For example, in chemistry, you wouldn't boil a chemical and not use it in the experiment. That would be unnecessary.

## Swapping two numbers

This is the pseudo code for swapping two values.
We won't always use full language syntax in algorithms
#+BEGIN_NOTE
This particular function only works for languages that support "pass by reference" like C/C++. Read more [here](https://www.javadude.com/articles/passbyvalue.htm)
#+END_NOTE

```js
function swap(a, b){
	tmp = a;
	a = b;
	b = tmp;
}
```
## Criteria for Analyzing Algorithms

Time and space are the most important criteria when analyzing algorithms
### Time

How long will the algorithm take to run?

### Space

How much memory does the algorithm need to run?
There are other important characteristics we may care about, but are usually less important.
### Network Traffic

How much data needs to be sent over the network when the algorithm runs?




### Power

How much power does the algorithm need to run?

This is important when designing for mobile devices

### CPU Registers

Sometimes for low level software, you may need to know hardware details like how many CPU registers your algorithms needs.
### Time Analysis

Every "simple" statement in an algorithm takes one "unit" of time

If a procedure has 3 simple statements, it takes 3 units of time.

You can write this as $$f(n)=3$$

This is a **constant** value. It doesn't matter what you give it, it always takes 3 units of time.

For simplicity, we usually say things like `y = 3*a + 6*b` is just 1 unit of time. It's usually not necessary to go into such great detail
### Space Analysis

What is the space complexity of this algorithm? How much memory does it use?
((62f9c6d7-a570-43c5-87b3-9c9467cc11d9))
It uses 3 variables always, regardless of the input, so we say $$s(n)=3$$ which is also constant.


Each statement is one "unit" of time and each variable is one "unit" of space





# Frequency Count Method

{{video https://youtu.be/1U3Uwct45IY}}

## Frequency Count Method

The time taken by an algorithm can be determined by assigning one "unit" of time for each "statement"
If a statement is repeating, the frequency of execution will determine the time taken by the algorithm to run

### Sum of elements in array

```js
function(nums){
  sum = 0
  for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
    sum = sum + nums[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

### Time Complexity

If I give it an array of length n, the sum function runs n times, so the algorithm takes $$O(n) = n$$ time to run. We call this "order of n"
### Space Complexity

we have variables `sum`, `i` and `nums`
`nums` has space n "units" of space and `i` and `sum` and 1 "unit" of space.
Since `nums` has a space complexity of `n` so we say the space complexity is $$O(n) = n$$ "order of n"







### Matrix Addition

```js
function addMatrix(a,b){
  for(i= 0; i < a.length; i++){
    for(j = 0; j < a[0].length; j++){
      c[i][j] = a[i][j] + b[i][j];
    }
  }
}
```
### Time Complexity

Two for nested for loops, each taking n time.

n procedures executing n times

Order of n^2 or $$O(n^2)$$
### Space Complexity

variables `a,b,c` matrices.

variables `i,j` scalar variables.







# Time Complexity

{{video https://youtu.be/9TlHvipP5yA}}
How do we analyze time complexity for given code?

What things affect time complexity?
We need to figure out how many times `stmt` executes

## Normal for loops

`stmt` will be executed n times, so it's $$O(n)$$
```js
for(i=0; i<n;i++){
  stmt()
}
```

## Decrementing for loop

Even though `i` is decrementing, it will be executed n times, so it's also $$O(n)$$

```js
for(i=n; i>0;i--){
  stmt()
}
```


## Increment by two

```js
for(i=0; i<n;i+=2){
  stmt()
}
```

In this code we increment by two, so it will be executed  n/2 times. It is $$O(n)$$ because n * anything is $$O(n)$$
## Nested for loops

```js
for(i=0; i<n;i++){
  for(j=0; j<n;j++){
    stmt()
   }
}
```
Each loop executes `n` times so `stmt` is executed `n` * `n` times or $$O(n^2)$$


## Dependent For Loops

What happens if the inner loop is dependent on the outer loop?
```js
for(i=0; i<n;i++){
  for(j=0; j<i;j++){
    stmt()
   }
}
```
Let's make a table to keep track of the values at each interation
|i|j|stmt executions|
|--|--|--|
|0|0|0|
|1|0 , 1|1|
|2|0, 1, 2|2|
|3|0, 1, 2, 3|3|
|...|...|...|
|n|0,1,2,...,n|n|
How many times is `stmt` executed?
The outer loop goes from 0 to n
When `i` is 1, `stmt` is executed 1 times
When `i` is 2, `stmt` is executed 2 times
Finding out how many times `stmt` is executed is the same as the [[integer-sum-formula]]




This is equivalent to 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + n
We can use $$f(n)=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
This can be expanded out to $$f(n)=\frac{(n^2+n)}{2}$$
This is simplified to to $$O(n^2)$$ because we only care about the biggest exponent.










## Outer loop does not execute n times

```js
p=0
for(i=1; p<=n;i++){
 p=p+i
  stmt()
}
```

How many times is `stmt` executed?
Let's make a table that shows the values at each iteration
|i|p|
|--|--|
|1|0+1=1|
|2|1+2=3|
|3|1+2+3|
|4|1+2+3+4|
|k|1+2+3+...+k|
We can use the [[integer-sum-formula]] again to find `p` for a given  `i`

$$ P=\frac{k(k+1)}{2} $$
When will this loop stop? when `p > n`

Let's replace `p` with our formula and simplify
$$\frac{k(k+1)}{2} > n $$
This can be expanded out and simplified to $$k^2$$ (we know we only care about the exponent for big o time complexity analysis)



$$k^2> n $$
$$k > \sqrt{n}$$
Therefore, the time complexity is $$O(n^2)$$







### Multiply i value

```js
for(i=0; i<n;i=i*2){
  stmt()
}
```
How many times will this execute?
|k|i|
|--|--|
|1|1|
|2|2|
|3|2^2|
|4|2^3|
2^k
assume`i>=n`  which breaks the loop
$i=2^k$
$2^k=n$





$k=\log_2 n$


The time complexity is $O(\log n)$

### Divide i value

```js
for(i=0; i<n;i=i/2){
  stmt()
}
```
$$\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2^2},\frac{n}{2^3},...$$
i < 1
$\frac{n}{2^k} = 1$
$n=2^k$
$k=\log_2 n$
The time complexity is $O(\log n)$









# While loops and If

{{video https://youtu.be/p1EnSvS3urU}}

How can we analyze functions with while loops and if statements?
We can make a table of values to understand the exection
```js
while (m != n){
  if (m > n){
    m=m-n
  } else {
    n = n-m
  }
}
```
|m=16|n=2|
|--|--|
|14|2|
|12|2|
|10|2|
|8|2|
|6|2|
|4|2|
|2|2|
We can see that with an input of 16, it will run 7 times, so 16/2 = 8, which can give us the upper limit



The time complexity is n/2 which simplifies to $O(n)$


# Classes of Functions

{{video https://youtu.be/w7t4_JUUTeg}}
## Types of time functions

These are listed in increasing size
### Constant time $O(1)$

Always runs in a fixed amount of time, doesn't depend on input

$f(n)=2$ or $f(n)=5000$ are both constant, which is described as $O(1)$
### Logarithmic $O(log(n))$

$\sqrt{n}$

### Linear $O(n)$

$f(n)=2n+3$ and $500n+700$ both simplify to $O(n)$

$O(n * log(n))$
### Quadratic $O(n^2)$

### Cubic $O(n^3)$



### Exponential $O(2^n)$


### Sample values for different classes

|$\log_2 n$|$n$|$n^2$|$2^n$|
|--|--|--|--|
|0|1|1|2|
|1|2|4|4|
|2|4|16|16|
|3|8|64|256|
We can see that the growth is much faster for the exponential equations
When n gets large, $n^{100}$ will always be less than $2^n$

# Asymptotic Notation

{{video https://youtu.be/A03oI0znAoc}}
## Big O - $O$

Upper Bound
$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means there are positive constants c and k, such that $0 ≤ f(n) ≤ c * g(n)$ for all $n ≥ k$.
If you were to graph big of bounding function, your function's value would always be less than the big O upper bound
![image.png](../assets/image_1666066293557_0.png)

- [NIST](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/theta.html)
If you have a function $f(n)=2n+3$
What's an example of a function that will always be greater?
$10n > 2n+3$ 10 is the constant c, from the Big o definition $c *g(n)$



Try to use the closest function for the upper bound, even though higher values like $n^2$ could be the upper bound, it's less useful




## Big Omega - Ω

Lower Bound

Similar to Big O notation, but your function will always be greater than the omega function
$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means there are positive constants c and k, such that $ f(n) ≥ c * g(n)$ for all $n ≥ k$.
![image.png](../assets/image_1666138709938_0.png)




## Theta - Θ

Average Bound
$f(n) = Θ (g(n))$ means there are positive constants $c_1, c_2$, and k, such that $0 ≤ c_1*g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c_2 * g(n)$ for all n ≥ k.

Consider $f(n) = 2n+3$
$1 *n <= 2n +3 <= 5 * n$
$c_1 * g(n) <= f(n) <= c_2 * g(n)$
In this case $f(n) =Θ(n)$





Since this is average notation, you can't use $Θ(n^2)$, it's out of the bounds




![image.png](../assets/image_1666139032348_0.png)






# Properties of asymptotic notation

{{video https://youtu.be/NI4OKSvGAgM}}
## General Property

if $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ then $a * f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$

e.g. $f(n) = 2 * n^2 + 5$ is $O(n^2)$
$f(n) = 7 (2n^2 +5) = 14n^2 + 35$ is $O(n^2)$

## Reflexive Property

If $f(n)$ is given, then $f(n)$ = $O(n)$

ex $f(n) = n^2$ then $O(n^2)$
## Transitive Property

if $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ and $g(n)$ is $O(h(n))$

then $f(n)$ is $O(h(n))$
if $g(n)$ is upper bound for $f(n)$ and $h(n)$ is upper bound for $g(n)$, then $h(n)$ is also an upper bound for $f(n)$


## Symmetric Property

Only true for Θ notation

if $f(n)$ is $Θ(g(n))$ then $g(n)$ is $Θ(f(n))$

e.g $f(n) = n^2$ , $g(n) = n^2$

$f(n) = Θ(n^2)$
$g(n) = Θ(n^2)$


## Transpose Symmetric

True for $O$ and  $Ω$
if $f(n) =O(g(n))$ if $g(n)$ is $Ω(f(n))$

eg $f(n) = n$, $g(n) =n^2$
then $n$ is $O(n^2)$ and $n^2$ is $Ω(n)$

if $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ and $f(n)= Ω(g(n))$
$g(n)$ is acting as both lower bound as well as upper bound
So $g(n) <= f(n)  <= g(n)$

then $f(n) = Θ(g(n))$



ex. If $f(n)=O(g(n))$,  $d(n)=O(e(n))$

Then $f(n) + d(n)= ?$

$f(n) = n = O(n)$
then $f(n) + d(n) = n + n^2 = O(n^2)$
When adding, take the bigger term
$f(n) + d(n) , O(max(g(n), d(n)))$



Also $f(n) * d(n) = f(n) * d(n^2) =O(g(n) * e(n))$






# Comparison of functions

{{video https://youtu.be/mwN18xfwNhk}}
If we have two functions, how can we show which is the upper bound and which is the lower bound?

For example, $n^2$ vs $n^3$
We can sample values and observe which is greater in a table
|$n$|$n^2$|$n^3$|
|--|--|--|
|2|$2^2=4$|$2^3=8$|
|3|$3^2=9$|$3^3=27$|
|4|$4^2=16$|$4^3=64$|
Apply $log$ on both sides
$n^2$ vs $n^3$
$log(n^2)$ vs $log(n^3)$
This simplifies to $2log(n)$ vs $3log(n)$
2 * log(n) <= 3 * log(n)





We can see that 2log(n) is always less than 3log(n)



## Logarithms guide

$log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b)$
$log(\frac{a}{b}) = log(a) - log(b)$

$log(a^b) = b *log(a)$
id:: 635b2d2c-4f81-49d7-9390-456ccba5468b
$a^{log_c(b)} = b^{log_c(a)}$
id:: 635b2d44-6aac-455e-8fe6-6c765994e514
$a^b=n$ then $b=log_a(n)$
id:: 635b2d93-ffb1-44e1-8610-81de1bbcc984





## Comparison of functions

### First example

$f(n)=n^2*log(n)$
$g(n) = n * log(n)^{10}$


apply $log$

$f(n)$

$log[n^2*log(n)]$

$log(n^2) + log(log(n))$
$2 * log(n) + log(log(n))$

$g(n)$

$log[n* log(n)^{10}]$
$log(n) + log(log(n))^{10}$

$log(n) + 10 * log(log(n))$


### Second Example

### $f(n)=3*n^{\sqrt{n}}$

### $g(n) = 2^{\sqrt{n} * log_2(n)}$

using the property ((635b2d2c-4f81-49d7-9390-456ccba5468b))
$2^{log_2(n)^{\sqrt(n)}}$
using the property ((635b2d44-6aac-455e-8fe6-6c765994e514))
$(n^{\sqrt{n}})^{log_2(2)}$
$log_2(2)=1$
so it simplifies to $n^{\sqrt{n}}$






so $f(n)=3*n^{\sqrt{n}}$ and $g(n)=n^{\sqrt{n}}$
### Third example

### $f(n) = n^{log(n)}$

Apply log
$log(n^{log(n)})$
The power inside the log statement comes out via the third formula

((635b2d2c-4f81-49d7-9390-456ccba5468b))

$log(n) * log(n)$


### $g(n)=2^{\sqrt{n}}$

Apply log
$g(n)=2^{\sqrt{n}}$
$g(n)=log(2^{\sqrt{n}})$
The power inside the log statement comes out via the third formula

((635b2d2c-4f81-49d7-9390-456ccba5468b))
$g(n)=\sqrt{n} * log(2)$

Simplify to one $log_2(2)=1$





So $f(n) = log(n)^2$ and $g(n) = \sqrt{n}$




# Best, Worst, and Average Case Analysis

{{video https://youtu.be/lj3E24nnPjI}}

## Linear Search

Given a list `[8,6,12,5,9,7,4,3,16,18]`
And we want to search for `7`
Linear search starts at the first element, checking each element one at a time moving from left to right
If we search for something that doesn't exist like `20` it will search from left to right until it reaches the end of the list.


### Best Case

The best case is the fastest the algorithm can possibly run

In linear search, If the element you're searching for is present at the first index, that's the best case.
Best case time is $O(1)$ , it will always take one iteration no matter how long the list is, if the key value is at the first index

### Worst Case

The worst case is the slowest the algorithm can run
In linear search, if the element you're searching for is present at the last index, that's the worst case.
Worst case is $O(n)$ because you have to search every element in the list


### Average Case

All possible case times divided by number of cases. Usually this isn't feasible to find, so we rarely do it and focus on the worst case time instead

To find this, you find all possible cases, add up time taken in each possible case, and divide by the number of cases

What are the cases of linear search?

Key present at first index, key present at second index, etc
If at first index, then 1 comparisons
If at second index, then 2 comparisions
etc
So 1 + 2 +3 + .. +n is the total possible case time

and there are n possible cases
We can use [[integer-sum-formula]] to add up the time of all cases
$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
We divide the total case time by the number of cases
$$\frac{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}{n}$$
We simply by dividing out n at the top and bottom, and are left with
$$\frac{(n+1)}{2}$$







Which is the average case time





### Asymptotic notation

Don't confuse best, worst, and average case with Big O, Big Omega, and Theta

Best case and worst can be expressed using any of these. Big O isn't only used to express worst case
Best case can be expressed using any of these notations

Best case(n) = 1

Best case(n) = $O(1)$
Best case(n) = $Ω(1)$
Best case(n) = $Θ(1)$








## Binary Search

![Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 2.22.08 PM.png](../assets/Screenshot_2022-11-28_at_2.22.08_PM_1669681356817_0.png)
If you're searching for `15`, start at root `20`
Is `15` bigger or smaller than `20`? smaller so move left
Then check `10`, is `15` larger than `10`? larger, so move right

### Best Case

If the element you're searching for is the root, the best case time is constant 1


### Worst Case

In the worst case, the element you're searching for is a leaf
So the worst case is the height of the binary tree, which is $log(n)$

So the worst case is $log(n)$

### Unbalanced binary search tree

![Screenshot 2022-11-28 at 2.28.42 PM.png](../assets/Screenshot_2022-11-28_at_2.28.42_PM_1669681918917_0.png)
A binary tree could be unbalanced, this binary tree is left skewed

It has the height `n`
The best case is still `1` when the element is at the root



However, the worst case is the height of the tree, which is `n` in this case, so the worst case is `n` whereas the worst case for a balanced binary tree is $log(n)$
